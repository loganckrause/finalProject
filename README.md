# CosmoRunner README

**Project By:** Logan Krause and Gavin Montross
**Year:** Freshman

**Demo Video Link:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoOPrV6OOKE

**Challenges/Difficulties we overcame:**

We originally had the idea of implementing procedurally generated levels, but instead, we decided to make each level and randomize the order that they occur. 
We had to learn how to use the engine, as well as learning Godot Script, which was very similar to using python so it was not a bad transisiton. 
We wanted to make our own assets for everything in the game, but made just the player and a few animations, and then the other assets used were from creative commons, such as Itch.io.
We aimed to make the enemies spawn in after you enter the level, but due to time constraints, we had to move on from that idea. 
Lastly, we wanted to make a lot more levels, including different environments such as a snow, forest, or mountian area. 
Overall, we learned a lot about the Godot engine, and learned to collaborate with each other to make something we are proud of.
