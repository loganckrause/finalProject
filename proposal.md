# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

CosmoRunner

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A rouge-like game with endless worlds and upgrades to buy after each run. Game itself will be a fast paced 2D platformer, taking inspriation from Risk of Rain.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The game will have mouse-based shooting mechanics, where you can move your reticle(cursor) around the screen and aim it at the enemies. It will feature a hub area that is a spaceship, and the player will be able to purchase upgrades, and drop down to start runs out of the ship. The world will be procedurally generated, with it becoming harder the longer you live. The project will be executed by using the Godot game engine and writing scripts in Godot Script. We also will make our own sprites using Aseprite. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Yes, there will be two of us working on the project, Gavin Montross, tuq61645@temple.edu, and Logan Krause, (email). Our TA is Xinwen Zhang.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
